# Terraforming Mars Online Manual

This is my first CSS practice project, aiming to create an online version of the manual for the board game Terraforming Mars.

The original game manuals printed PDF form can be found on the creator's website, at: https://www.fryxgames.se/TerraformingMars/TMRULESFINAL.pdf

Obviously, no claim of ownership over any art assets or intellectual property is implied here - the manual simply served as reference for adaptation into a web document.

As of 27/07/2022, the project is not complete, but is in a position where I'm happy to display it as part of my progress in improving my knowledge of HTML and CSS since my Northcoders graduation.
